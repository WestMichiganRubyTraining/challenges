<h1>Git Challenge</h1>

<h2>Clone a Repo</h2>
Clone the Get Your Hands Dirty With Ruby challenges repo using `git clone`. You might want to keep it on your local machine even after the challenge. Contributing to this repo is highly encouraged!

<h2>Make Changes and Commit Them Locally</h2>
* Open the cloned repo in your favorite text editor.
* Create a new branch to work from. Add your name to the list of Git champions. 
* Commit your changes to your local machine.

<h2>Push to Github and Make Pull Request</h2>
Now that you've committed your changes in a separate branch, you can push them up to your own git repo. Go to Github and put in a pull request so your project will be merged into the original one. Once it's merged, don't forget to `git pull` the newly updated version onto your computer and `git push` it back up to your own repo. Your now the proud collaborator of an open source Ruby Users Group project!

<h2>**BONUS POINTS**</h2>
You've got the basics of collaborating on Github, so why not contribute to this repo? Either add a new challenge course, or start with something simpler, like adding external resources.
